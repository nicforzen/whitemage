# whitemage

A Unity-inspired 2D Javascript game engine that can share client/server code.

## Description

This is still heavily in development as a passion project.

## Use

Running `npx webpack` will build `whitemage.js` which you can use in a browser or in Node.
Alternatively just grab a release!
This section will be fleshed out in the future.
